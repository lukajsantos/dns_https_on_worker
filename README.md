# dns_https_on_worker

This JavaScript code is designed for a Cloudflare Worker, enabling you to create a custom DNS upstream server directly on Cloudflare's edge network. It offers flexible functionality:

Targeted Upstream Servers: The code allows you to specify particular DNS servers to which queries are forwarded.
Caching: It incorporates caching mechanisms to improve response times and reduce upstream server load.
Versatile Usage: The Worker can function purely as a caching proxy, or as a full-fledged DNS server with custom endpoints, providing adaptable DNS resolution capabilities."
Here are some alternative phrasings for specific parts, if desired:

"…enabling you to deploy a custom DNS upstream server…"
"…offers flexible functionality, operating either as a dedicated cache…"
"....providing flexible DNS resolution options."
